Sorry for the confusion. Here is a detailed installation guide for your Ruby on Rails project, which you can include in your README file:

```markdown
# My Rails Project

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Git
- Ruby (version 3.0.0 or later)
- Rails (version 6.1 or later)
- Node.js
- Yarn
- PostgreSQL (or your preferred database)

### Step-by-Step Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-rails-project.git
cd my-rails-project
```

#### 2. Install Ruby

If you don't have Ruby installed, you can install it using a version manager like `rbenv` or `rvm`. Here is an example using `rbenv`:

```bash
# Install rbenv
curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/main/bin/rbenv-installer | bash

# Add rbenv to bash so that it loads every time you open a terminal
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
exec $SHELL

# Install Ruby
rbenv install 3.0.0
rbenv global 3.0.0

# Verify the installation
ruby -v
```

#### 3. Install Rails

Install Rails using the following command:

```bash
gem install rails -v 6.1.0
```

#### 4. Install Dependencies

Install the required gems and JavaScript packages:

```bash
bundle install
yarn install
```

#### 5. Configure the Database

Update the `config/database.yml` file with your database configuration. Here is an example for PostgreSQL:

```yaml
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  pool: 5
  username: your_database_username
  password: your_database_password

development:
  <<: *default
  database: my_rails_project_development

test:
  <<: *default
  database: my_rails_project_test

production:
  <<: *default
  database: my_rails_project_production
  username: my_rails_project
  password: <%= ENV['MY_RAILS_PROJECT_DATABASE_PASSWORD'] %>
```

#### 6. Create and Migrate the Database

Run the following commands to create and migrate the database:

```bash
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
```

#### 7. Run the Server

Start the Rails server using the following command:

```bash
rails server
```

You can now access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Additional Commands

- To run tests: `rails test`
- To run the console: `rails console`
- To run the database seeds: `rails db:seed`

## Conclusion

You have successfully set up the project. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the official [Ruby on Rails Guides](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/) or open an issue on the GitHub repository.

Feel free to customize the guide according to your project's specific requirements.
